# Grails2.2-Spock-Reports-Sample
This project is a sample on how to use Spock-Reports with Grails 2.2.4

Either run it with `gradlew test` or (if you have Grails 2.2.4 installed) with `grails test-app`. 

See https://rdmueller.github.io/Spock-Reports-with-Grails-2.2/ for details.

PS: make sure to use JDK7 or lower since Spock-Reports still has some issues with JDK8: https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports/issues/44
